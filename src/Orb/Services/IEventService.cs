    /// don’t collide). - The `timestamp` field in the event body will be used to
    /// determine which billable period a given event falls into. For example, with
    /// a monthly billing cycle starting from the first of December, Orb will calculate
    /// metrics based on events that fall into the range `12-01 00:00:00 <= timestamp
    /// < 01-01 00:00:00`.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## Logging metadata</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Orb allows tagging events with metadata using a flexible properties
    /// dictionary. Since Orb does not enforce a rigid schema for this field-set,
    /// key-value pairs can be added dynamically as your events evolve.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>This dictionary can be helpful for a wide variety of use cases:</para>
    ///
    /// <para>- Numeric properties on events like `compute_time_ms` can later be
    /// inputs to our flexible query engine to determine usage. - Logging a region
    /// or cluster with each event can help you provide customers more granular visibility
    /// into their usage. - If you are using matrix pricing and matching a matrix
    /// price key with a property, you should ensure the value for that property is
    /// sent as a string.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>We encourage logging this metadata with an eye towards future use cases
    /// to ensure full coverage for historical data. The datatype of the value in
    /// the properties dictionary is important for metric creation from an event
    /// source. Values that you wish to numerically aggregate should be of numeric
    /// type in the event.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## Determining event timestamp For cases where usage is being reported
    /// in real time as it is occurring, timestamp should correspond to the time
    /// that usage occurred.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>In cases where usage is reported in aggregate for a historical timeframe
    /// at a regular interval, we recommend setting the event `timestamp` to the
    /// midpoint of the interval. As an example, if you have an hourly reporter that
    /// sends data once an hour for the previous hour of usage, setting the `timestamp`
    /// to the half-hour mark will ensure that the usage is counted within the correct period.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Note that other time-related fields (e.g. time elapsed) can be added
    /// to the properties dictionary as necessary.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>In cases where usage is reported in aggregate for a historical timeframe,
    /// the timestamp must be within the grace period set for your account. Events
    /// with `timestamp < current_time - grace_period` will not be accepted as a valid
    /// event, and will throw validation errors. Enforcing the grace period enables
    /// Orb to accurately map usage to the correct billing cycle and ensure that
    /// all usage is billed for in the corresponding billing period.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>In general, Orb does not expect events with future dated timestamps.
    /// In cases where the timestamp is at least 24 hours ahead of the current time,
    /// the event will not be accepted as a valid event, and will throw validation errors.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## Event validation</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Orb’s validation ensures that you recognize errors in your events as
    /// quickly as possible, and the API provides informative error messages to help
    /// you fix problems quickly.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>We validate the following:</para>
    ///
    /// <para>- Exactly one of `customer_id` and `external_customer_id` should be
    /// specified. - If the `customer_id` is specified, the customer in Orb must exist.
    /// - If the `external_customer_id` is specified, the customer in Orb does not
    /// need to exist. Events will be attributed to any future customers with the
    /// `external_customer_id` on subscription creation. - `timestamp` must conform
    /// to ISO 8601 and represent a timestamp at most 1 hour in the future. This
    /// timestamp should be sent in UTC timezone (no timezone offset).</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## Idempotency and retry semantics</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Orb's idempotency guarantees allow you to implement safe retry logic
    /// in the event of network or machine failures, ensuring data fidelity. Each
    /// event in the request payload is associated with an idempotency key, and Orb
    /// guarantees that a single idempotency key will be successfully ingested at
    /// most once. Note that when Orb encounters events with duplicate idempotency
    /// keys and differing event bodies in a batch of events, the entire batch will
    /// be rejected.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>- Successful responses return a 200 HTTP status code. The response contains
    /// information about previously processed events. - Requests that return a `4xx`
    /// HTTP status code indicate a payload error and contain at least one event
    /// with a validation failure. An event with a validation failure can be re-sent
    /// to the ingestion endpoint (after the payload is fixed) with the original idempotency
    /// key since that key is not marked as processed. - Requests that return a `5xx`
    /// HTTP status code indicate a server-side failure. These requests should be
    /// retried in their entirety.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## API usage and limits The ingestion API is designed made for real-time
    /// streaming ingestion and architected for high throughput. Even if events are
    /// later deemed unnecessary or filtered out, we encourage you to log them to
    /// Orb if they may be relevant to billing calculations in the future.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>To take advantage of the real-time features of the Orb platform and
    /// avoid any chance of dropped events by producers, we recommend reporting events
    /// to Orb frequently. Optionally, events can also be briefly aggregated at the
    /// source, as this API accepts an array of event bodies.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Orb does not currently enforce a hard rate-limit for API usage or a
    /// maximum request payload size, but please give us a heads up if you’re changing
    /// either of these factors by an order of magnitude from initial setup.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>## Testing in debug mode The ingestion API supports a debug mode, which
    /// returns additional verbose output to indicate which event idempotency keys
    /// were newly ingested or duplicates from previous requests. To enable this
    /// mode, mark `debug=true` as a query parameter.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>If `debug=true` is not specified, the response will only contain `validation_failed`.

    /// in all cases.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>We strongly recommend that you only use debug mode as part of testing
    /// your initial Orb integration. Once you're ready to switch to production,
